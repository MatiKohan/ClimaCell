## Comments

It was a really nice assignment. it was my first interaction with automated test in general and Jest specificly, i learned a lot.
I know there are a lot of more tests that can be done and also the code maybe can be more simple, those are part of the things that i want to learn.
I hope it's ok.
Thank you very much.
